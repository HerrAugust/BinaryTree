# BinaryTree
In this project binary trees are randomly generated and then showed.

You can generate a random binary tree with:
  int height = 3;
  BinaryTree<Integer> mybinarytree = BinaryTree.generaCasuale(height);

You can show your binary tree with:
		new Visualizzatore("Name of window", new Dimension(400,400), new Point(0,0), mybinarytree);
		you have to state the name of the window, its dimension, its position on your desktop and pass your binary tree.
		
Please do not treat this code bad and have fun! =)
